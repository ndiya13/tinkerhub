### Project Description
*ResQHub* is a centralized platform designed to streamline disaster resource management and relief coordination. It connects responders, volunteers, and affected communities, enabling real-time tracking, allocation, and deployment of essential resources during emergencies. The goal is to ensure faster, more efficient disaster response¬†and¬†recovery.

### The Problem statement
Disaster response often suffers from inefficient resource allocation, lack of real-time coordination, and communication gaps between responders, volunteers, and affected communities. This leads to delays and uneven distribution of essential aid during¬†emergencies.

### The Solution
We‚Äôre building *ResQHub*, a smart platform that acts like a disaster superhero! It connects everyone‚Äîrescue teams, volunteers, and those in need‚Äîso resources like food, water, and help get to the right place fast, without¬†any¬†chaos.
